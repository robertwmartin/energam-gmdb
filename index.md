# ðŸŒŒ Welcome to the Enerverse!

Energam is an invitation-only community of storytellers and adventurers who play tabletop roleplaying games together using Foundry VTT. You can think of Energam as the player community, with the Energam Discord acting as the central hub for announcements, scheduling, rules clarifications, and game discussions. I just happen to think "Enerverse" sounds cool, so I am using that word as well. 

This menu exists to guide you through the core options available to you as a player, whether you're just joining or looking for your next character concept.

## What Can We Play?

We currently use 5e for our sessions, and are currently migrating from the 2014 rules to the 2024 rules. Other systems will be added over time. Campaigns and one-shots vary in tone and rules â€” browse the current lineup:

## What Can I Play As (5e)?

Energam supports a variety of official, unofficial, and legacy 5e content.

- WotC sources like *TCoE*, *PHB 2024*, and both the *SRD 5.1* and *SRD 5.2*
- Legacy content like *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide* available via homebrew support as long as the player owns the material
- Select third-party supplements to expand Race / Origin / Lineage options, as well as custom Classes and Subclasses. These are often from large, successful game developers such as Free League or Kobold Press
