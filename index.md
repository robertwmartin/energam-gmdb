# ðŸŒŒ Welcome to the Enerverse Menu

Energam is an invitation-only community of storytellers and adventurers who play tabletop roleplaying games together â€” mostly online, often using Foundry VTT, and always in good company.

This menu exists to guide you through the core options available to you as a player, whether you're just joining or looking for your next character concept.

> ðŸ§­ **What is Energam?**
> Energam is our player community. The Energam Discord is the central hub for announcements, scheduling, rules clarifications, and memes.
