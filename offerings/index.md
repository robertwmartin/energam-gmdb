# Enerverse Offerings

A core aspect of the Enerverse is the connections, possibilities, threats, and opportunities created by having the ability to access the multiverse. The primary mechanism for accessing the multiverse is a homebrew city called Usley that has been retconned on the western shore of the Dragonmere in Faerun. Through this connection to the multiverse, players and GMs will be able to connect and experience different worlds, and also different game systems for those worlds. The ruleset used for the multiverse connection is [Labyrinth](https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/labyrinth-worldbook/) from Kobold Press.
