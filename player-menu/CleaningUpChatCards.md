**Did You Know #1 - Cleaning Up Chat Cards**

*What is a Chat Card?* 
Chat Cards are the boxes in the Chat Message section of Foundry that display your rolls, spells, whispers, etc. 

One thing I realized recently is that the settings I configure to customize how chat cards are displayed do not get applied to your sessions. I have the ability to login as the players, and when I do that it looks like my settings were applied. That was because I was already logged in on that computer though, and not because they are global settings. 

*Chat Portrait*
There is a Foundry Module called Chat Portrait that cleans up the chat cards. It also adds colour to the background of the chat card based on the colour each user had selected in their User Configuration. The first image is what an unmodified chat card looks like with vanilla Foundry, and the second is the same chat card modified via Chat Portrait.

Note that the duplicate token is removed and the background colour matches what I have selected in User Configuration. 

*How To*
If you want to do that, there are a few settings in Game Settings --> Configure Settings --> Chat Portrait that you will want to change. Note that the third and fourth attached screenshots below are from my documentation and are slightly different than what you will see.

Specifically: 

- "Disable chat portrait" will remove the duplicate token
- "Use Token name" and "Use Avatar Player Image" help keep things consistent if there are issues with the token / player names
- "Change Color of Message Background" syncs the chat card colour with the colour each player selected in User Configuration. The impact of that setting is shown in the first and second images above
- "Add a textual tag to chat messages" is nice because it will show if a roll was a blind, private, or self roll, and it will show if something in the chat was a whisper to you

Note that you need to set this up for each computer you log in with. 

Hopefully this helps makes the Foundry experience a bit better for you.
