# 🧙 Character Options in the Enerverse

Energam supports a broad range of 5e player options — but not all options are equal in terms of support, stability, and availability in Foundry. This guide explains what you can build your character from, based on source tier and availability.

---

## 📘 Tier 1: Official WotC Sourcebooks

These sources are fully supported and maintained in Foundry VTT, either natively or via premium content modules.

Included:

- *Tasha's Cauldron of Everything* (TCoE)
- *Player’s Handbook 2024 Edition* (PHB 2024)
- *System Reference Document (SRD) 5.1*

🧠 These sources have complete data integration, automation, and support in our game system.

> ⚠️ If *SRD 5.2* is officially published and conflicts with SRD 5.1, we may evaluate whether to replace or support both.

---

## 📗 Tier 2: Legacy Sourcebooks (WotC)

These sources are officially published by Wizards of the Coast, but are not fully supported in Foundry. Characters built from these books may require custom implementation.

Examples:
- *Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide* (SCAG)
- *Xanathar's Guide to Everything*
- *Volo's Guide to Monsters* (for race/species content)

🛠 You are welcome to build from these sources, but you may need GM support to create abilities, items, or subclasses manually.

---

## 📙 Tier 3: Third-Party & Unofficial Content

These include options from reputable third-party publishers or creators not affiliated with WotC. They may be included for variety, challenge, or flavor, but are not guaranteed to work seamlessly in Foundry.

Examples:
- Kobold Press (e.g., *Tome of Heroes*)
- Mage Hand Press
- MCDM
- Custom Energam subclasses or races

> 🧪 Use of these options is **subject to GM approval** and may be rebalanced between sessions.

## 🚧 Experimental or Custom Content

If you're interested in homebrewing a class, subclass, or race, we encourage collaboration. Submit ideas to the GM in advance — some may eventually become part of the broader Enerverse offering.

## ❓FAQ

> **Can I use Unearthed Arcana (UA)?**  
> Generally no, unless pre-approved. UA content is not always balanced or implemented in Foundry.

> **What about older PHB 2014 material?**  
> If it's not duplicated in the PHB 2024 or SRD 5.1, we may allow it as Tier 2 content, but will likely favor updated wording and mechanics.

> **Can I mix and match sources?**  
> Yes, within reason. But duplicated subclasses or species with different versions must follow a consistent interpretation — speak to the GM if unsure.
