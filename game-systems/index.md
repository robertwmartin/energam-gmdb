# ðŸ§© Game Systems

So many games, so little time!

While 5e is great, it isn't the only game system available. Hell, it is the fifth edition of its own lineage. There are several additional rulesets available to be played. It might take time to get ramped up to play with a different game system, but if you are interested in any of the following or others not on this list, make a suggestion on the Discord.

## Current Systems
