# ðŸ“œ 5e House Rules

The following house rules apply to all Enerverse games using the 5e system.


<!-- discord:general -->
## General

No rolls unless asked! Plus, it would be better if you described what you want to do instead of saying "I want to roll Perception", for example

We will use Fumble / Crit charts. You will have access to macros for the appropriate roll

Variant Encumbrance will be used. (PHB, page 176)

Milestone XP will be used

It takes an Action to drink anything - including a Potion

(Edited for v1.1) Levelling up will use rolled HP, not average. Any 1s can be rerolled, including 1s that are rolled on rerolls. Dice rolls must be done in game chat, #bot-spamdump, or a campaign specific channel like #prep-and-planning

Feline animals, including familiars, NPCs, and creatures get Darkvision. Similarly but conversely, any Bats will have DIS in daylight for Perception or Insight checks

Attuning to a magic item takes 1 minute. Note that attuning will only identify the properties of the item once it is attuned, and curses are not automatically known by any means

If you need to Unattune a magic item, that will take 10 minutes of uninterrupted focus

Try to refrain for providing specifics like current level of HP

Discord naming convention - Name / PC Name / Class. If you are playing in multiple campaigns, pick one or do Name / PC #1 Name / PC #2 Name

(Added for v1.1) Party of 3, 4, or 5 can proceed with one absent player. Party of 6 can proceed with two absent players

(Added for v1.1) Explorer's Packs and other packs that come with Level 1 characters should be able to hold everything that comes with it - capacity should be 60+ pounds

The following feats are not available:

Telekinetic (Tashaâ€™s)

Observant

Bountiful Luck

Luck

The following magic items are not available:

Candle of Invocation

Deck of Many Things

Efreeti Bottle

Iron flask

Ring of Three Wishes

Luck Blade

Well of Many Worlds

Wand of Wonder

Ring of Djinni Summoning

Bag of Tricks

Tome of the Stilled Tongue

Belt of giant Strength

Potion of Giant Strength

Rod of Resurrection

Helm of Brilliance

Bag of Beans

Staff of the Magi

(Added for v1.1) Immovable Rod



Edited locations where level up rolls could go

Added Immovable Rod to unavailable magic items

Added line about proceeding with absent players

Added line about capacity of packs


<!-- discord:skills -->
## Skill Checks

Insight is not a Lie Detector, and your player character will not automatically know if the person is lying

If two players are rolling trying to deceive each other or determine ulterior motives of each other, the need for any contesting Insight and Deception rolls are determined by the target player. The target player can determine if a roll is needed

For skill checks that rely on INT and WIS, you only get one chance

Knowledge-based rolls can never benefit from Help or ADV

In order for one player character to help someone else, the Helper needs to be proficient in the skill. The Helper needs to describe how they will help, and the Help action will be awarded at the discretion of the DM. If Help is granted, both players roll and the highest roll is kept




<!-- discord:combat -->
## Combat

Once per combat, the party can elect to have two players swap initiative. Doing so will cost a Bonus Action by the player that is initially higher in the Initiative order

No Flanking

Speaking During Combat - Characters can speak 10 words for free. Anything longer or more engaging than that requires the use of the character's Bonus Action but responses are not given until the responding player's turn. In other words, you are speaking, nota conversing

Performing a skill check like Perception will count as your player's action for that round. It is unlikely that your player will be able to do an Investigation in one round of combat




<!-- discord:movement -->
## Movement

Moving through but not stopping in an occupied space is allowed if the space is occupied by an ally. If the space is occupied by an enemy, the player character must attempt an Athletics or Acrobatics check (player's choice) opposed by Athletics or Acrobatics check (GM's choice). Success means can move through square but as Difficult Terrain. Failure means the player character is blocked in square in front of enemy. Normal Attack of Opportunity rules still apply

Travel speeds are defined as:

4 mph walking, 8 hours max per day, 32 miles max per day

6 mph riding, 10 hours max per day, 60 miles max per day

4 mph sailing, 24 hours max per day, 96 miles max per day

## Need to have the spell components for anything you have to purchase

Verbal has to be audible. It cannot be whispered

(Edited for v1.1) Somatic will not work if you are bound or your hands are tied. If an arm is broken, the spell might be cast at DIS

Useful link in helping determine how to handle material components for spells

Ritual Casts are limited to once per day per ritual spell, with the reset at dawn

Identify will be modified to be a 1 minute ritual. It will give the player some of the information but not all, and does not find curses or some hidden abilities. Identify only works on items that are very rare and lower


<!-- discord:death -->
## Death and Damage

Falling to 0 HP gives 1 point of Exhaustion

The GM will roll Death Saves and will not reveal the result of the roll. The exception is if a 20 is rolled, which will then result in the player character returning to 1 HP and regaining consciousness

A Medicine check without a Medicine Kit acts as a Death Save, but the players get to roll
